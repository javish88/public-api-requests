## Create your js/scripts.js file and wire it up to the HTML

You may use jQuery if you like.

Other frameworks, libraries or plugins are not permitted.

## HTML

You'll be provided with a basic index.html file to use in your project. But this file is missing the main components of the app, which you will need to create and add to the DOM dynamically.
Comments in the index.html file contain examples of the markup you'll need to add. So use the markup in those comments as a template. And keep in mind that altering the arrangement of the markup and the attributes used may break the styles or functionality.

## Structure, style and CSS
Your finished project should match the general position and layout of the mockups. If you followed the arrangement and attributes of the template markup in the HTML comments, then the provided styles should accomplish this for you.
You are encouraged to experiment with things like color, background color, font, shadows, transitions and animations to make this project your own.

## Get and display 12 random users
## With information provided from The Random User Generator API https://randomuser.me/ , send a single request to the API, and use the response data to display 12 users, along with some basic information for each:
Image
First and Last Name
Email
City or location
Refer to the mockups and the comments in the index.html file for an example of what info should be displayed on the page and how it should be styled.

## Create a modal window
When any part of an employee item in the directory is clicked, a modal window should pop up with the following details displayed:
Image
Name
Email
City or location
Cell Number
Detailed Address, including street name and number, state or country, and post code.
Birthday
Make sure there’s a way to close the modal window
Refer to the mockups and the comments in the index.html file for an example of what info should be displayed on the page and how it should be styled.

## Add good code comments

## Extra credit

## Search
Add a way to filter the directory by name. To do this, you’ll need to adjust your API request to retrieve a user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet.
Example markup for this feature is included in the HTML comments.
## Note: Your search feature should filters results that are already on the page. So don't request new info from the API for your search.

## Modal toggle
Add a way to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open.
There should be no errors once the end or beginning of the list is reached.
Example markup for this feature is included in the HTML comments.

## Structure, style and CSS
Add or change at least one of the following:
color
background color
font
box or text shadows
Document your style changes in your readme file and the project submission notes.
Do not alter the layout or position of the important elements on the page.
